NVIDIA Profile Inspector - Version 2.1.2.0 (.NET Framework 4 or above)

- nvidiaProfileInspector is now open source and licensed under MIT license.
  (https://github.com/Orbmu2k/nvidiaProfileInspector)

- there are also continues builds available outside of the update cycle of nvidiaInspector
  (https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Orbmu2k/nvidiaprofileinspector/build/artifacts)

- added option to include predefined settings to the exported nip file
- fixed when all string fields got persisted on apply changes even if no changes was made to them
- fixed when the import removes the predefined settings of a profile if they are not included in the nip file
- fixed clicking the refresh button may crash the application for some users

-------------------------------------------------

NVIDIA Inspector - Version 1.9.7.5 (.NET Framework 2 or above)

- removed obsoltete profile settings jump list entry
- fixed cuda lib error 

NVIDIA Profile Inspector - Version 2.1.1.1 (.NET Framework 4 or above)

- reverted back to default font
- fixed layout problems (hopefully)


-------------------------------------------------

NVIDIA Inspector - Version 1.9.7.4 (.NET Framework 2 or above)

- replaced old ROP calculation with new API call, this should fix ROP count for Maxwell 2 cards with reduced L2 Cache
- increased unlocked UI clock limit for non boost states to fix error with memory clocks beyond 4000MHz
- improved max boost clock estimation for maxwell
- completely removed settings profile editor from main application, it is now deployed as standalone application

NVIDIA Profile Inspector - Version 2.1.1.0 (.NET Framework 4 or above)

- completely reworked settings engine backend
- removed update detection / autoupdate
- updated to latest available settings api R352
- added stereo setting name detection from driver lib (thx to DarkStarSword)
- default custom setting names are now embedded to the exe file, and can be extracted with command line switch "-createCSN"
- added some GSYNC settings to CSN
- profile export now exports only customized settings without the nvidia predefined settings
- profile import now resets the profile to current driver defaults before import
- changed framerate limiter value selection to predicted fps instead of the raw api value
- you can drag'n drop nip files or application shortcuts now
